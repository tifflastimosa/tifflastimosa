🎓 I am a former Paralegal, now pursuing a Software Engineering in Seattle, WA. Currently, pursuing a Computer Science Master's Degree at 
Northeastern University. I will be graduating December 2022.

👩🏽‍💻 I am currently working on obtaining an AWS Solutions Architect certification and building a scalable distributed cloud-based system in AWS. Moreover, I am looking to participate in more Hackathons and open source projects. 

🐶&nbsp; I have a corgi named Gizmo. During the summer, you can find us at the park, but on most rainy days you can find us at home playing chase and tug-of-war. 

🎾&nbsp; When I am not coding, I love to play tennis. My current ranking is USTA 3.5, and I am looking to improve. When the weather is no longer ideal, I love to cook and try new recipes. 

🤓&nbsp; I am a huge fan of Star Wars and I love reading. Currently reading Leia: Princess of Alderaan by Claudia Gray. It's a coming of age story of General Leia Organa.
